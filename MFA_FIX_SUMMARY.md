# MFA Challenge Fix Summary

## Issue
The `MsalUiRequiredException` was not getting surfaced to the frontend as a proper 401 response with WWW-Authenticate header, preventing the frontend MFA handler from working.

## Root Cause
The `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` was commented out in `Program.cs`, meaning MFA exceptions were not being caught and converted to proper 401 responses.

## Solution
**Minimal Change**: Uncommented the `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` in `Program.cs` (line 158).

```diff
// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
app.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
// app.UseMiddleware<SecurityHeadersMiddleware>();
- // app.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();
+ app.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();
```

## Verification
- ✅ All 62 tests pass
- ✅ All 5 MFA-specific tests pass  
- ✅ Build succeeds with no new errors
- ✅ Complete MFA infrastructure was already in place and tested

## Result
Now when Azure DevOps APIs require MFA:

1. **Backend**: `AzureDevOpsApiService` catches `MsalUiRequiredException` → throws `MfaChallengeException` → `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` returns 401 with WWW-Authenticate header
2. **Frontend**: `ApiClient` detects MFA challenge → `MfaHandler` prompts user for MFA → retries request with new token

The complete end-to-end MFA flow now works as designed.
